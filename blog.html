        <h3>📅 August 2025 — Automating Growth with WhatsApp Bots</h3>
        <p class="small">Posted on August 1, 2025</p>
        <p>
          This month I went deep into automation. I built a WhatsApp bot that handles anti-delete, anti-call features, and recovers "view once" content—giving users superpowers on a platform they already live in. It’s not just about code; it’s about boosting persistence and making digital interactions smarter for creators and communities.

        <p>
          Tailwind turned styling from chore to craft. I rebuilt key portfolio components with utility-first precision, making responsive layouts feel effortless. This wasn’t just learning a framework—it was upgrading how I think about design system scalability and iteration speed.

        <p>
          I dove into Django and shipped a full blog platform with authentication, admin controls, and clean data modeling. The built-in patterns gave structure, and I learned how to move from idea to backend-powered MVP in days instead of weeks.

        <p class="small">Posted on May 5, 2025</p>
        <p>
          Before adding frameworks and JS, I focused on structure—semantic HTML that loads fast and communicates clearly. This post walks through why starting with no dependencies sharpened my markup discipline and gave me a foundation for everything built after.
