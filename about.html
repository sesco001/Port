      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        Hey, I’m <strong>Meshack Matheka</strong>, widely known as <em>Makamesco</em>. I’m a Kenyan developer, teacher trainee, and self-driven technologist with a relentless hunger to learn, build, and solve real problems. What started as curiosity and trial-and-error has turned into a journey of continuous growth—one new skill every month, one project at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bridge education and technology. My training as a teacher fuels my empathy for users and learners, while my passion for development pushes me to build tools, websites, and systems that are not only functional but meaningful. I believe that tech should empower communities, simplify complexity, and create opportunities where none existed before.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently a teacher trainee in Kenya, and alongside that path, I’ve immersed myself in the tech ecosystem—from building static HTML/CSS sites to architecting more dynamic applications. I’ve collaborated on several projects, both independently and with others, tackling real-world challenges in digital presence, automation, and user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey hasn’t been about waiting for the perfect moment; it’s been about showing up, experimenting, failing, iterating, and shipping. I constantly remix knowledge from design, development, and education to create solutions that work for people, especially those in environments where resources are limited but ambition is high.
      </p>

      <h2>Values & Approach</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> I learn something new every month—whether it’s a framework, a language, or a workflow improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong> I prioritize projects that help others—students, creators, small businesses, and communities.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> I turn complexity into intuitive experiences. If it can be made easier to understand or use, I’ll refine it.</li>
        <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> I build, ship, and support. If it’s my project, I’m in it from idea to deployment.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> I value learning with others, sharing openly, and lifting up the people I work with.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Skills & Tools</h2>
      <p>Some of the technologies and tools I’ve been working with and mastering over time:</p>
      <ul class="skills-list">
        <li>HTML & Semantic Markup</li>
        <li>CSS (responsive design, utility-first thinking)</li>
        <li>JavaScript & APIs</li>
        <li>Backend basics (Node.js, simple REST services)</li>
        <li>Version control with Git & GitHub</li>
        <li>UI/UX thinking (wireframing, user empathy)</li>
        <li>Automation (bots, workflows)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What’s Next</h2>
      <p>
        I’m constantly evolving. Right now I’m deepening my knowledge in full-stack development, automation tools (like WhatsApp bots), and building platforms that help creators and small enterprises scale their digital footprint without unnecessary friction. My roadmap includes expanding into scalable services, making my projects more collaborative, and mentoring others beginning their own tech journeys.
      </p>

      <p class="callout">
        If you’re here because you believe in building something real—whether it’s a website, a bot, a learning resource, or a collaboration—let’s connect. I’m always open to ideas, feedback, and partnerships.
